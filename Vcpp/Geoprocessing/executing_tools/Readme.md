###Purpose  
This sample uses the IGeoprocessor object to perform a number of geoprocessing operations. This sampleÂ extracts features to a new feature class based on a location and an attribute query.   


###Usage
1. Copy the test data to C:\data folder.  
1. Start Visual Studio.  
1. Open the solution (*.sln) file.  
1. If your data is not in C:\data folder, change the hard-coded paths to data in the gp_copyfeatures.cpp file.  
1. Build the solution.  
1. Run the program (start debugging or press F5).  
1. Start ArcMap.  
1. Drag and drop the districts and contaminated_areas feature classes.  
1. The output shows only those contaminated sites that fall within the districts.
