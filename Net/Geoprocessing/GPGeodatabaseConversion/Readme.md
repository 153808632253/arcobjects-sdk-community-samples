##Using list functions to migrate from personal geodatabases to file geodatabases

###Purpose  
A common conversion task is the large-scale transfer of data from one format to another. This sample takes advantage of ListWorkspaces, ListFeatureClasses, ListTables, and ListDatasets to identify the personal geodatabases in a folder and converts the feature datasets, feature classes, and tables of each to file geodatabases.  


###Usage
1. Change the workspace paths to a local workspace containing personal geodatabases.  
1. Compile and run the project.
