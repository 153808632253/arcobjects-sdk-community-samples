##Navigating around the GlobeControl

###Purpose  
This sample demonstrates how to control the size, position, and spin speed of the globe object in the GlobeControl. There is a command button provided to allow globe documents to be selected. However, control of the globe can be seen with or without globe data loaded, since the globe is visible as a wire mesh when no data is loaded.   


###Usage
1. Browse to a globe document to load into the GlobeControl.   
1. Navigate around the globe using the command buttons in the application.   
1. Control the globe position and size using the option buttons and mouse.   
1. Set the globe spinning using the check box and control the spin speed with the slider control.

The option buttons either enable the GlobeControl's default navigation functionality or use the mouse events to provide zoom in and out functionality. The check box and slider control the spin and spin speed of the GlobeViewer. </div>
