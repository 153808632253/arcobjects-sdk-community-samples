##Printing with the PageLayoutControl

###Purpose  
This sample demonstrates changing the PageLayoutControl's page properties and printing the page to the system default printer. The Browse dialog box allows you to search and select map documents, which are validated and loaded into the PageLayoutControl using the CheckMxFile and LoadMxFile methods. Whenever the FormID, Orientation, or PrinterToPageMapping properties of the page are changed, the number of pages to be printed is updated using the PrinterPageCount property. Before the PageLayout is sent to the printer using the Print method, the orientation of the printer's paper is aligned to that of the page's paper.   


###Usage
1. Browse and select a map document to load into the PageLayoutControl.   
1. Change the page size, orientation, and printer to the page mapping properties.   
1. Before printing the page layout, specify the page range to be printed and whether there is to be any overlap between pages.

This is dependant on the IPage.StretchGraphicsWithPage property. </div>
