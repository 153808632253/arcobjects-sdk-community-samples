  <h2>WPF Globe Gallery</h2>

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>This sample shows how to host the ArcGIS Engine Globe .NET control with the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) classes. It displays various exported thumbnails from globe (.3dd) documents and takes advantage of WPF features such as image translation. All of the WPF elements are defined in Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML) includingÂ various templates and styles. The sample also shows how to do the following:Handle license initializationCreate and host the control with a WindowsFormsHostFormat control styles with XAMLHandle WPF and Globe control eventsWire up existing tools to WPF controlsRelease Component Object Model (COM) objects  </p>

<li>Start Visual Studio.   </li>
<li>Press F5 to run the sample.  </li>
<li>Play the Zoom Slider to view map images in the gallery.  </li>
<li>Double-click an image to open the Globe Viewer window, which displays the associated .3dd file in the ArcGIS Globe control. Multiple Globe Viewer windows can be opened simultaneously (it can take longer to open the first map, but should be faster when opening subsequent maps).  </li>
<li>Click the tools such as Navigation, Fly, and TargetZoom to view the globe map. When done with the Fly tool, press Esc to release it.  </li>
<li>Close the Gallery window.  </li>
