  <h2>Move a graphic along a path in ArcMap</h2>

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>This sample implements the move-object-along-path functionality for ArcMap animation. It allows you to move a point graphic element or a text element along a selected line feature or a selected line graphic. A new animation type (Map Graphic animation type) and its corresponding keyframe (Map Graphic keyframe) are implemented to support moving a graphic along the path. It also implements an ArcMap command for creating a move-object-along-path animation. The purpose of this sample is to show how to create a custom animation type in ArcMap and how to implement an ArcMap command to import the animation tracks. To create a custom animation type, implement a new keyframe class and a new animation type class.   </p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<h4>Add and use the move-graphic-along-path functionality in ArcMap</h4>

<ol>
<li>Compile the sample project in Visual Studio.  </li>
<li>Start ArcMap and click Customize, Toolbars, and Animation. The Animation toolbar appears.  </li>
<li>Click Customize, then Customize Mode. The Customize dialog box appears.  </li>
<li>On the Commands tab, locate the Animation Developer Samples category.  </li>
<li>Drag the Move Graphic along Path command from the Animation Developer Samples category to the Animation drop-down on the Animation toolbar. Close the Customize dialog box.  </li>
<li>Add a line feature layer on to the table of contents (TOC) in ArcMap; or alternatively, draw a line graphic element on the ArcMap display.  </li>
<li>Draw a point graphic element (or a text element) on the display and symbolize it as necessary.  </li>
<li>Select the point graphic element (or the text element) and a line feature (or line graphic). The Move Graphic along Path command is enabled.  </li>
<li>On the Animation drop-down, click the Move Graphic along Path command.  </li>
<li>Accept all default settings and click the Import button on the Move Graphic along Path dialog box to create a track.  </li>
<li>Play the animation and the point graphic element (or text element) moves along the selected path.  </li>
</ol>
