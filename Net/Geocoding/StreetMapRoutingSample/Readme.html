  <h2>StreetMap routing</h2>

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>This sample shows how to utilize the StreetMap routing application programming interface (API). It is an implementation of a simple dialog box allowing you to set from and to stop addresses along with other routing settings, such asÂ calculate a route, display route geometry on the map, and display driving directions text.  </p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<ol>
<li>Open the solution file in Visual Studio and build the project.  </li>
<li>Start ArcMap.  </li>
<li>Click the Customize menu, click Toolbars, and click Routing Sample to enable the Routing Sample toolbar.  </li>
<li>Click the button on the Routing Sample toolbar to open the Routing Sample dialog box.   </li>
<li>Browse to the location of a routing service file (.rs extension) and select it in the Routing Service field.  </li>
<li>Browse to the location of an address locator file and select it in the Address Locator field.   </li>
<li>Type the address of the starting location for driving directions in the Start section and the address of the ending location in the Finish section.  </li>
<li>In the Options section, specify the type of route, quickest or shortest, to be calculated. Specify the distance units and select the street type preference for routing using the slider bar; for example, moving the slider towards Use Local Roads causes the router to utilize non-highway roads as much as possible in the output driving directions.  </li>
<li>Optional. Click the Restrictions button to open the Restrictions dialog box. If the data referenced by the routing service file specified in step 5 contains restriction attributes, this dialog box will be populated with the available restriction parameters. Set the restrictions in this dialog box as desired.   </li>
<li>Optional. If a point feature class containing barrier features is available, browse to it in the Barriers Table field.  </li>
<li>Click the Find Route button to generate a list of driving directions and display a route graphic in ArcMap.  </li>
<li>Click the Show Directions button to open the Driving Directions dialog box, which contains the list of driving directions.  </li>
</ol>
