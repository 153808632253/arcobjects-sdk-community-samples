##Create a Mosaic dataset

###Purpose  
This topic shows how to create a Mosaic dataset, add rasters to it using one of the built-in raster types, calculate cell size ranges, build a boundary, and define and build overviews for it.  


###Usage
1. Start Visual Studio and open the solution file.  
1. Edit the strings in the "Setup MD Test Parameters" region to specify the parameters that control where to create the Mosaic dataset, where to add data from, the raster type to use, and so on.  
1. Compile and run the program.  
1. If the program succeeds, the console shows a "Success" message. If an error occurs, it shows on the console window.  
1. Load the created Mosaic dataset into ArcMap or ArcCatalog.
