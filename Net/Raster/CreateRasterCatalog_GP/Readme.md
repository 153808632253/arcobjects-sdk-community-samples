##Create a raster catalog using the geoprocessor

###Purpose  
This sample uses the geoprocessor class in conjunction with CreateRasterCatalog and WorkspaceToRasterCatalog geoprocessing tool classes to create a raster catalog, and load a directory of rasters to the raster catalog. It demonstrates the recommended approach for creating and loading raster catalogs from rasters in a folder.  


###Usage
1. Open the solution file in Visual Studio.  
1. Modify the data paths to your input data path and output geodatabase.  
1. Run the sample.  
1. Browse to the output geodatabase and refresh the connection. The new raster catalog with all the rasters from the input directory appears.
