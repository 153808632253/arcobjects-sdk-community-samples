##Mosaic raster datasets to a geodatabase raster dataset

###Purpose  
This sample demonstrates the recommended approach to create a raster mosaic in a geodatabase (file geodatabase or ArcSDE geodatabase) from rasters in a folder using geoprocessing tool classes. The task involves two stepsâ€”create an empty raster dataset and mosaic rasters in a folder (optionally subfolders) to the new raster dataset.  


###Usage
1. Open the CreateRasterMosaic solution file.  
1. Review the source code and make any changes to the data location and loading options.  
1. Compile and run.  
1. Check the output geodatabase raster dataset. It should be a mosaic of all the raster datasets in the input folder.
