##Custom Root Object (Style Gallery)

###Purpose  
The GxStyles sample demonstrates how to create custom GxObjects and a custom GxView. It introduces a new root node (called Style Gallery) that when expanded, contains a tree structure of styles. Individual styles can be previewed with a new custom view that is available under the Preview tab.   


###Usage
1. Register the compiled .dll (that is, CustomRootObject_CS.dll) file. For more information, see "How to register COM components" in the following "See Also" section in this sample.  
1. Start ArcCatalog. A new root node (called Style Gallery) shows.   
1. Expand this node and select a style.  
1. Preview the style by clicking the Preview tab.
