##Angle Angle shape constructor

###Purpose  
This sample demonstrates how to create a shape constructor. The angle-angle shape constructor adds points to the edit sketch based on the input of two point locations and two angles. An angle intersection is constructed based on these inputs. If a new point is not calculated, a message dialog box appears indicating this.    


###Usage
1. Compile and register the .dll.  
1. Start ArcMap and load some data.  
1. Customize ArcMap and add the shape constructor to the Editor toolbar.  
1. Select a feature template and a construction tool.  
1. Click the Angle-Angle shape constructor. Add three mouse points to view the next edit segment.
