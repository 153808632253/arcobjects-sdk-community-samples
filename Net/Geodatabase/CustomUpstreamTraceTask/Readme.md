##Custom upstream trace task

###Purpose  
This sample demonstrates how to create a custom trace task. The trace task implemented in this sample performs an upstream trace that works exactly the same as the Trace Upstream task that is provided with ArcMap.  


###Usage
1. Open the .sln file in Visual Studio and compile it.  
1. Start ArcMap and make the Utility Network Analyst toolbar visible.  
1. Add a geometric network to the map.  
1. Using either the Edge Flag tool or the Junction Flag tool, add at least one flag to the geometric network.  
1. Optionally, on the Utility Network Analyst toolbar, click Analysis and click Disabled Layers to disable layers. To set other analysis options, click Analysis and click Options.  
1. In the Trace Task drop-down list, select the Custom Upstream Trace task.  
1. Click the Solve button.
