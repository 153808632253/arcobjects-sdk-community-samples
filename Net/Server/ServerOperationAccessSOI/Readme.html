  <h2>Server operation access</h2>

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>This sample illustrates how to filter access to individual operations available on the map server. Three operations – "find", "identify", and "export" – are checked against the incoming request’s user’s role. See Deploying extensions to learn how to deploy the extension to your server.  </p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<ol>
<li>Define at least two new custom roles in you ArcGIS Server site called "gold" and "platinum".  </li>
<li>Associate one or more users to those two roles, as well as other roles.  </li>
<li>Deploy NetOperationAccessSOI.soe to your server.  </li>
<li>Attach the SOI to a map service of your choice.  </li>
<li>Optionally, secure the service.  </li>
<li>Observe how the find, identify, and export operations are only available when the request is authenticated and the authenticated user is in either the gold or platinum roles.  </li>
</ol>
