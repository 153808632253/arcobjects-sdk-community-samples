##Simple logger

###Purpose  
The sample illustrates the basic framework for creating a server object interceptor (SOI). The SOI adds a message to the ArcGIS Server log whenever a REST request is received before forwarding the request to the underlying default implementation.Â See Deploying extensions to learn how to deploy the extension to your server.  


###Usage
1. Deploy NetSimpleLoggerSOI.soe to your server.  
1. Review the ArcGIS Server logs to see messages indicating REST requests are received before requests are forwarded to the underlying default implementation.
