##Extension to listen to document open and save events

###Purpose  
A component can listen to events fired by the application when a document is created, opened, or closed. However, no event is fired when a document is saved. ToÂ log the time when a document is saved, create a custom extension that implements persistence. This sample shows how to implement an application extension that logs user and date time information when a document is opened or saved.   


###Usage
1. Open and compile the sample project in Visual Studio. Set up a debug application if needed.   
1. Start ArcMap, ArcScene, or ArcGlobe.  
1. Open or save a document.   
1. Check the status bar for a message with the user name and time information of the event.
