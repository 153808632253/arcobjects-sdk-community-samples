##Create a custom tool

###Purpose  
This sample demonstrates how to create a tool. Tools are commands that enable the user to interact with map and page layout documents. The tool is created by inheriting the BaseTool class from ESRI.ArcGIS.ADF.Local. This sample contains the code demonstrated in the walkthrough, Create a custom tool.  


###Usage
1. Open and compile the solution.  
1. Start ArcMap.  
1. Click on Customize menu and choose Customize mode… to open the Customize dialog box. Scroll down to the Walkthroughs section in the Commands tab's Categories pane.  
1. In the Commands pane, click and drag the Draw Graphic Line command on to the ArcMap graphical user interface (GUI). Close the Customize dialog box.  
1. Click the added tool to activate it, click the map window in ArcMap to anchor the first point of the line, move the mouse pointer and click again (repeat as necessary), then double-click to end the line added as a graphic in the active view.
